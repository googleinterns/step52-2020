      <p  id="introInfo" class= "intro" >Hi I'm Cynthia. I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science and Statistics at Cornell University. 
        I like photography and playing tennis and traveling. I was born and raised in New York and spend most of my time 
        taking pictures, hanging out with my friends, or learning new things. I like to read and do my best to keep reading even 
        when life gets hectic.
